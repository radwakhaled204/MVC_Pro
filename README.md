#  ASP.NET MVC Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project is built using the ASP.NET MVC framework as a learning exercise to explore and implement new features, tools, and techniques in web development. The primary objective is to create a functional web application that demonstrates the core concepts of the MVC design pattern while integrating various modern web technologies.

---

## Objectives
- **Learn and Apply ASP.NET MVC Concepts:** Understand the structure and flow of the Model-View-Controller pattern.
- **Experimentation:** Implement features like routing, views, and controllers to gain practical experience.
- **Problem Solving:** Address real-world web development challenges.
- **Enhance Reusability:** Build components that can be used in future ASP.NET MVC projects.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Routing**
- Configured custom routes for clean and user-friendly URLs.
- Used attribute routing for specific controller actions.

### 2. **Models and Database Integration**
- Created models to represent data entities.
- Integrated with a database using **Entity Framework** for CRUD operations.

### 3. **Controllers**
